# AdventureLandCollision
Maps out world into polygons.

Recursive search of intersecting lines to determine polygon. Check if point is in polygon with https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-check-if-a-given-point-lies-inside-a-polygon.

Primary use is the isPointInPolygon(x, y) function. This will return true if a point is in a polygon, tree, house, cliff.

TODO:
  optimize recursive function
  
  check if islands are pathable (I have to reach any depth to the game)
