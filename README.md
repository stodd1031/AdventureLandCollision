Maps out world into polygons.

Recursive search of intersecting lines to determine polygon. Check if point is in polygon with https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-check-if-a-given-point-lies-inside-a-polygon.

TODO:
  optimize recursive function
  check if islands are pathable (I have to reach any depth to the game)
